🧠 Summary: FCC Broadband Data Processing (Alabama)

Here’s a structured and human-readable guide to the process you’ve documented. This includes all your Stata and Python prep steps for replicating FCC calculations for Alabama broadband access using BDC data and the FCC staff’s population estimates.

⸻

📂 Initial File Prep
	1.	Stacking Tech Files
	•	Append all tech-specific .dta files into one file.
	•	Final file contains rows of: location_id, provider_id, and technology.
	2.	Removing Duplicate Providers per Location
	•	In Stata:

gsort  location_id provider_id -max_advertised_download_speed
quietly by location_id provider_id: gen dup=cond(_N==1,0,_n)
drop if dup>1


	•	Output file: duplicates removed.dta

	3.	Identifying 100/20 Mbps Providers
	•	Create a binary column: 1 if speed ≥ 100/20, else 0.
	•	Collapse by location (either binary flag or provider count).
	•	Merge with Fabric data.
	•	Drop business-only locations (business_type == "B").

👥 Merge with FCC Population Data
	4.	Merge With Staff Population Estimates
	•	Join population estimate data on location_id.
	5.	Drop Empty Locations
	•	Drop if both unit_count == 0 and population == 0.

⸻

🐍 Python Round One Prep
	6.	Prepare Input Files for Round One
	•	Filter to locations where:
	•	unit_count > 0
	•	population > 0
	•	Create:
	•	A file with: location_id, block_geoid, unit_count
	•	A second file: population per block_geoid

⸻

🐍 Python Round Two Prep (“The Fun Part”)
	7.	Extra Calculations for Advanced Population Assignment
	•	Create new variables for each block group:
	•	unit_count_group
	•	Units in blocks with no population
	•	Population in blocks with no units
	•	Flags:
	•	pop_unit_pos (has both)
	•	pop_zero_unit_pos (units > 0, pop = 0)
	8.	Create Input File for Python
	•	File includes:

keep blockgroup_str unit_count unit_count_group location_id pop_unit_pos pop_zero_unit_pos units_no_pop_sum_group
destring blockgroup_str, gen(blockgroup)
drop blockgroup_str
save ...


	9.	Merge Population Block Data
	•	Merge population-only file (pop_no_units_by_group) with the main file.
	•	Drop missing population values.
	10.	Final Cleanups
	•	Drop locations with missing location_id
	•	Re-save merged file
	•	Re-merge for updated max population per block group (where unit count is missing)

🧠 Observations & Suggestions

💡 Potential Simplifications
	•	Instead of repeated merges/drops/resaves, consider scripting it all into one .do or .py pipeline.
	•	Consider exporting intermediate datasets to CSV for lightweight checks/debugging or parallel processing.

🗂️ File Organization
	•	Your use of naming conventions (date + process stage) is 👏 solid. Just make sure they’re consistent (e.g., 07.12.23 vs 09.26.23).

🔁 Reusability
	•	This pipeline is robust. With slight param tweaks, it could scale to other states.
